# Roadmap

Feature ideas and improvements for DeepCogs.

## Completed

- [x] **Wantlist Integration** - Add releases to Discogs wantlist from recommendations
- [x] **Deep Cut Finder** - Discover rare releases (test pressings, promos, limited editions)
- [x] **Shareable DNA Cards** - Download collection DNA as PNG for social sharing
- [x] **Trade Finder** - Bidirectional matching: what you can offer + what they can offer
- [x] **OG vs Repress** - Show original pressings vs represses breakdown

## Removed

- ~~Country Distribution~~ - Removed (added complexity without enough value)
- ~~Progressive Loading~~ - Removed (degraded UX)

## Ideas

### Collection Rediscovery
Smart groupings to rediscover your collection based on style, niche, era, time period, or geography. Examples: Zouk, Spiritual Jazz, French 90s Urban Rap, Grunge Era, UK Garage from the UK.
